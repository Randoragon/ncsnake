# ncsnake - a simple ncurses snake game

This repository holds the source code for my first ncurses program - a small snake game.
This is by no means a serious project, just some practice to learn the ropes of the library.

## Installation

Make sure you have ncurses installed and run the following command (if necessary, as root):

    make install
